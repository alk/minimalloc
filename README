This is experiment at doing some not very quick (but hopefully decent)
malloc that tries to minimize fragmentation.

Approach taken is address ordered best-fit which appears to be best
possible general purpose allocation strategy.

Implementation is using rbtree from libbsd to find best-fit reasonably
quickly.

Note, this is not thread safe at all. Have your own locking if this is
what you need. Given that, performance will likely suffer even more
in multi-threaded environments, but we don't care that much.
